!!! cite "Mycorrhizae"
    _**Mycorrhizae** are a **symbiotic association between plant roots and fungi**.
    Their major role is to enhance nutrient and water uptake by the host plant
    by exploiting a larger volume of soil than roots alone can do. Mycorrhizae
    come in a number of forms, dependent upon both host plant and fungal taxonomy._
