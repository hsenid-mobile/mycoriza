     _**Mycorrhizae** are a **symbiotic association between plant roots and fungi**.
    Their major role is to enhance nutrient and water uptake by the host plant
    by exploiting a larger volume of soil than roots alone can do. Mycorrhizae
    come in a number of forms, dependent upon both host plant and fungal taxonomy._

# Mycoriza.

Mycoriza is a `typescript library / code generator` for integrating _Rest API_ to react applications.

* **Painless**: Mycoriza makes the Rest API integration ridiculously easy by providing a toolset to generate more
  react-ish, _well documented_ network layer boilerplate. This helps the developers to spend there valuable time on more important problems
  than network integration.


* **Explicit**: In react applications, classic way of handling the asynchronous behavior is often confusing and requires more
  effort in maintaining. Mycoriza incorporates more explicit approach by modeling the promises as states, and provides
  the necessary tools to mine information in typesafe manner.


* **Safe**: Mycoriza ensures the type-safety through strong `typescript` support and integration-safety through easy
  and typesafe API client generation.
