    <i><b><i>Mycorrhizae</i></b> are a <b>symbiotic association between plant roots and fungi</b>.
    Their major role is to enhance nutrient and water uptake by the host plant
    by exploiting a larger volume of soil than roots alone can do. Mycorrhizae
    come in a number of forms, dependent upon both host plant and fungal taxonomy."</i>

!!! card "Painless" 
    _Mycoriza makes the Rest API integration ridiculously easy and helps the developers to spend there valuable time on more important problems
    than network integration._

!!! card "Explicit"
    _Mycoriza prefers State based approach to Promise handling, which is natural to react._

!!! card "Safe"
    _Mycoriza ensures the type-safety through strong `typescript` support and integration-safety through easy
    and typesafe API client generation._
