# Getting Started

The easies way of creating a mycoriza react project is through
the `create-react-app` cli. Use following commands to create
a react application with mycoriza toolchain setup.

## Prerequisites

Currently, mycoriza supports OpenAPI v3. OpenAPI v2 support is planned to be developed.

## How to create a project.

Run following command to initiate a Mycoriza react project. This will create a
react single page web application with necessary dependencies and toolchains.

```shell
npx create-react-app <project-name> --template mycoriza
```

## Post-creation steps.

The mycoriza template contains the basic setup to boot up a mycoriza project. To add initial swagger source,
run following command


### 1. Add sources.
```shell
cd <project-name>
npx mycoriza add
```

This will generate `mycoriza.config.json`, which contains the configuration of general flags and sources.
While adding the sources to mycoriza, the necessary configurations related to the source are collected interactively.
Please refer [CLI Usage](/cli-usage/#add-swagger-source) for further information.

The API client hooks and types can be generated by running following command.

### 2. Update API to generate the sources.
```shell
npm run updateApi
```

Once you complete these steps, you can find the following generated code. 

## Information about generated code.
**Store** 

The store related configuration can be found in `<project-root>/src/store`
This code is generated only once and can be modified according to the 
project needs.

**API**
The domain types and the hooks can be found in `<project-root>/src/api` 
The changes you do in this codebase will be wiped out in each `updateApi`
execution. 

**Mycoriza configurations**

The configurations you add in the initial data `updateApi` call, are configurated
in the `package.json` file. 

**Documentation**

The API might be complicated and may requires additional time to understand.
Therefore, a comprehensive documentation is generated during the `updateApi`
phase, This API can be found in `<project-root>/docs/api`.
